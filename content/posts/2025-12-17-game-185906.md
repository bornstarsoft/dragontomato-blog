November 2025 marked a significant month for the RPG genre in China's livestreaming scene, with anime-style RPGs capturing the attention of millions. According to the Niko Partners China Games & Livestreaming Tracker, major version updates and anniversary events played a pivotal role in driving viewership, showcasing how dynamic content can engage audiences effectively. Notably, Kuro Games Wuthering Waves and miHoYos Zenless Zone Zero both experienced remarkable spikes in viewership due to their strategic livestream events.

Wuthering Waves, for instance, saw a staggering 36.5 million viewers, a 103% increase month-over-month, thanks to its Version 2.8 preview livestream. Similarly, Zenless Zone Zero attracted 30.9 million viewers, up 84% from the previous month, highlighting the power of timely updates and community engagement through platforms like Bilibili. These figures underscore the importance of livestreaming as a tool for game developers to connect with their audience and build excitement around new content.

As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see how these trends evolve and whether other genres will adopt similar strategies to captivate viewers. Will we continue to see RPGs leading the charge in livestreaming, or will new contenders emerge in the coming months?
