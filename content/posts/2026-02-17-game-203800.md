Nintendo has officially launched its Virtual Boy app on Switch Online, bringing a nostalgic selection of games from one of its most infamous consoles. Players can now dive into seven classic titles, including 3D Tetris and Virtual Boy Wario Land, all accessible through a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. To enhance the experience, a physical Virtual Boy accessory is required, available for purchase from the My Nintendo Store.

With only 22 games ever released for the Virtual Boy, this initial lineup represents a significant portion of the console's library, and Nintendo has plans to expand the offering with nine additional titles in the future. This move not only revives interest in the Virtual Boy but also highlights Nintendo's commitment to preserving its gaming history. As more games are added, will the Virtual Boy finally get the recognition it deserves among gaming enthusiasts?
