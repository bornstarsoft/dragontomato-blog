In a shocking turn of events, hardware sales and physical game spending in the US have hit their lowest point in 30 years this past November. According to Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, marking the worst performance since 1995. With hardware spending plummeting 27% year-over-year to just $695 million, its clear that the gaming market is facing significant challenges.

The average price for new gaming hardware reached an all-time high of $439, which many believe is a key factor behind the decline in sales. Traditionally, November is a peak month for gaming hardware purchases due to Black Friday and holiday shopping, but this years prices may have deterred consumers. The PlayStation 5 led the sales charts, followed by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S, but even these top consoles couldnt escape the downward trend.

Additionally, physical software sales fell 14% compared to last year, marking another record low for November since tracking began. While digital sales likely compensated for some of this decline, the overall sentiment in the gaming community is one of concern. As tariffs and component costs continue to rise, can console manufacturers find a way to lower prices and revive interest in dedicated gaming devices?
