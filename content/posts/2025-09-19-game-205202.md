Disordered Media is set to unleash a unique horror puzzle experience with the launch of oneway.exe on October 7 for PC and Mac. This first-person, single-player game promises to immerse players in a chilling narrative where they navigate through an unfinished game created by three developers whose lives took a tragic turn. With the first "Module" available at launch, players can expect subsequent chapters to delve deeper into the haunting story.

In oneway.exe, players will explore the eerie halls of UNTITLED.EXE, encountering a cast of eight memorable characters inspired by unsettling internet tales. The game cleverly simulates a full operating system, allowing players to interact with applications and files, creating a sense of realism that enhances the horror experience. As players uncover environmental clues and traverse through various paths, they will confront the digital horrors that blur the lines between reality and the virtual world.

With an original soundtrack composed by Marcy Nabors, known for DELTARUNE, the auditory experience will further amplify the tension and atmosphere. As we approach the launch date, one can't help but wonder: what other digital nightmares await us in this innovative horror puzzle game? Will you dare to explore the depths of oneway.exe?
