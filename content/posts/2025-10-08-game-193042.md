This annual event, organized by the North East fundraising group, has become a beloved tradition, drawing teams from across the region to compete in rounds covering a variety of topics, from general knowledge to music and sports. The funds generated play a vital role in supporting Marie Curie's mission to provide essential care for individuals living with terminal illnesses.
