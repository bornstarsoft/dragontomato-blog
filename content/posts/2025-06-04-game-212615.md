As we dive into June, Steam has once again surprised its users with an enticing selection of four free games that cater to a variety of gaming tastes. This month, players can explore narrative-driven adventures, action-packed gameplay, and even relaxing word games—all without spending a dime. It’s a fantastic opportunity for gamers to expand their libraries and experience new titles ahead of their full launches.

First on the list is **The Falling Star**, a first-person walking simulator that invites players to embark on a heartfelt journey. As you follow the protagonist in search of her missing aunt, the game offers an introspective narrative set in a beautifully fragmented dreamscape. For those who crave more action, **Sporeborne** delivers a thrilling hack-and-slash experience where you play as a mutated fungus battling enemies while uncovering new abilities.

If you prefer a more laid-back gaming experience, **Obgoose** is a delightful non-competitive word game that will challenge your vocabulary in a relaxed setting. Finally, **Gear Combination** presents a strategic puzzle challenge where players must combine gears to achieve specific rotation speeds. Each of these titles brings something unique to the table, making them perfect additions to your gaming repertoire.

With such a diverse lineup of free games available, there’s no better time to explore what Steam has to offer. Which game are you most excited to try out this month?
