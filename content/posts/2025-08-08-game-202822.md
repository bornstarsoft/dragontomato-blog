Sony has recently acknowledged that its transition from single-player games to live-service titles has not been as seamless as anticipated. During the Q1 2025 Earnings Call, CFO Lin Tao candidly admitted that the company is facing numerous challenges in its live-service strategy, which includes the postponement of key titles like Concord and Marathon. This admission resonates with players who have been vocal about the quality and delivery of these new gaming experiences.

Despite these setbacks, Tao highlighted that live-service games have grown significantly over the past five years, contributing to about 40% of sales in Q1. However, the company has scaled back its ambitions from launching 12 live-service games to just six by the end of fiscal year 2025, indicating a cautious approach moving forward. The reality is that while the potential for live-service games is immense, the execution has been fraught with difficulties.

As Sony navigates these turbulent waters, the question remains: can they learn from these missteps and successfully integrate live-service elements into their portfolio without sacrificing the quality that players expect? Only time will tell if their strategy will ultimately pay off or if it will lead to further disappointments.
