The highly anticipated mobile puzzle game, **Classroom of the Elite ~Merge Puzzle Special Exam~**, is set to make its debut in the Crunchyroll Game Vault, and fans can now pre-register on both the App Store and Google Play. Originally released in Japan in February 2024, this game promises an engaging experience with its unique blend of puzzle-solving and character development, making it a must-try for fans of the franchise and puzzle enthusiasts alike.

One of the standout features of this game is its commitment to providing a rich narrative experience, complete with full voice-acting and new story content. Players can expect to embark on missions, level up characters, and explore unlockable “school miniscapes” as they progress through the scenarios. Notably, the developers have emphasized a microtransaction-free model, allowing players to immerse themselves fully without the distraction of in-game purchases. The intriguing tagline, “Build relationships—or break them,” hints at a deeper social mechanic that could add layers of strategy to the gameplay.

As we await the premiere of the fourth season of the Classroom of the Elite anime, this game launch adds another exciting dimension to the franchise. With the light novel series also entering its third year, fans have plenty to look forward to. Will this puzzle game capture the essence of what makes Classroom of the Elite so compelling? Only time will tell.
