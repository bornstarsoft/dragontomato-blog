Square Enix's recent comparison video showcases the impressive capabilities of the Switch 2, particularly in how it handles the visually stunning Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade. The video pits the Switch 2 against the PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC versions, revealing that despite its lower power, the Switch 2 manages to deliver a visually appealing experience that can stand shoulder to shoulder with its more powerful counterparts.

One of the standout insights from the video is the emphasis on lighting as a crucial element in maintaining graphical quality. Naoki Hamaguchi, the games director, highlighted that preserving lighting effects was essential to avoid making the game feel cheap. This focus on lighting, paired with strategic optimizations in other areas, allows the Switch 2 version to run smoothly at 30 frames per second without significant visual degradation compared to the PS5 version.

As we look forward to the January 22 release of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on the Switch 2, it raises an interesting question: Can the Switch 2 redefine expectations for handheld gaming graphics?
