In an exciting development for football gaming enthusiasts, Netflix is set to release a new FIFA game this summer, just in time for the World Cup. The project is being led by Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer at Konami, who previously oversaw the development of the Fox Engine used in iconic titles like Metal Gear Solid 5 and the Pro Evolution Soccer series. This transition marks a significant shift in the gaming landscape, as Netflix aims to redefine the FIFA franchise away from its long-standing association with EA Sports.

Merceron's vision for the game focuses on a return to the core principles that made past football games beloved by fans. Alongside Refactor Games, the team is committed to creating an engaging experience that balances fun and depth, appealing to both casual players and hardcore fans. With the game designed to stream directly to televisions and mobile devices serving as controllers, it promises to deliver a unique and accessible gaming experience.

As we look forward to this innovative approach to football gaming, one can't help but wonder: will Netflix's FIFA game set a new standard for sports titles in the streaming era? Only time will tell, but the anticipation is certainly building.
