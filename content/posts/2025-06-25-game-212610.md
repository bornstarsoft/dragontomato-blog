Linking **Metroid Zero Mission** to **Metroid Fusion** is not just a nostalgic trip down memory lane; it’s a gateway to unlocking exclusive content that enhances your gaming experience. By connecting these two iconic titles via a link cable and holding START + SELECT while booting up Fusion, players can access the Metroid Fusion picture gallery in Zero Mission. This feature adds depth to the gameplay, allowing fans to revisit memorable moments from the series.

For those enjoying the Switch Online version of Metroid Zero Mission, the Fusion Gallery is already unlocked by default, provided you have the GBA app through the Switch Online Expansion Pack. This seamless integration not only highlights the clever design of the Metroid series but also showcases how Nintendo continues to innovate and engage its audience, even with titles from the past.

As we look forward to what Nintendo has in store for the future of the Metroid franchise, it’s exciting to think about how these connections between games can enrich our experiences. Have you tried linking these games yet, and what hidden gems have you discovered in the process?
