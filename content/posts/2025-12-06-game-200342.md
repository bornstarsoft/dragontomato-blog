Grasshopper Manufacture is eyeing the possibility of bringing its upcoming title, 'Romeo is a Dead Man', to the Nintendo Switch 2. However, the studio, led by the renowned Suda51, is currently assessing the technical feasibility of this transition, particularly in relation to Unreal Engine 5's advanced features like Nanite and Lumen. This careful consideration reflects the studio's commitment to delivering a seamless gaming experience across platforms.

In a recent interview, Suda51 emphasized the importance of Nintendo platforms to Grasshopper, citing their historical significance in the studio's journey. While the game is set to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 11, the potential for a Switch 2 version remains uncertain until the studio can ensure compatibility. As fans eagerly await more news, the question remains: will 'Romeo is a Dead Man' find its way to the Switch 2, and what could this mean for future titles from Grasshopper?
