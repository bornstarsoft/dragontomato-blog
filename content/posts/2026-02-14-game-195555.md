The 2026 Taipei International Game Show showcased the vibrant world of gaming culture, particularly at the "Dolls Frontline 2: Exilium" booth. With an array of stunning cosplayers bringing beloved characters to life, the booth became a hub of excitement and creativity. Fans had the opportunity to engage with their favorite characters, capturing memorable moments through photos and interactions.

Among the highlights were impressive cosplays of characters like "Macchiato" and "Mayuzumi Smoke," alongside the alluring presence of "Sentau Lacey" in a swimsuit. The booth also featured a Memory Puzzle Game that incentivized players based on their commander levels in the app, adding a layer of interactivity that fans appreciated. The blend of cool and cute aesthetics, especially with characters like "Kunkai" appearing in both swimsuit and battle attire, truly enchanted attendees.

As we reflect on the vibrant atmosphere of the Dolflo 2 booth, its clear that events like these not only celebrate gaming but also foster a community of creativity and passion. What were your favorite moments from the Taipei Game Show 2026?
