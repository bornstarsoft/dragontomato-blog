Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to thrill players with the introduction of Pac-Man content this week, alongside a surprise in-game festival. From January 7 to January 11, all players will have the chance to participate in the Pac-Man Festival, even those who dont own the new Pac-Man Pack, which features exciting new racers and a unique course.

This latest addition follows a trend of crossovers in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, with previous collaborations including beloved characters from SpongeBob SquarePants and Minecraft. Sega's commitment to delivering fresh content is evident, with more paid expansions on the horizon, including themes from Mega Man and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The games director has hinted at even more surprises throughout the year, ensuring that fans have plenty to look forward to.

As we dive into this new content, it raises the question: what other iconic franchises could join the racing fun in the future? The possibilities are endless, and it seems Sega is just getting started!
