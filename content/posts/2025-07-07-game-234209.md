Fans are buzzing with excitement as recent discoveries suggest that Nintendo may have inadvertently revealed upcoming titles for the Nintendo Switch Online service. A blurred segment in a May trailer has sparked speculation about several beloved N64 games, including the highly sought-after Super Smash Bros. and Donkey Kong 64, making their way to the platform.

The blurred images, first highlighted by Twitter user @ImakuniVT, hint at cover art for games not yet available on the service. While it remains to be seen whether this art is merely a placeholder or a sneak peek at future releases, the community is eager for confirmation. With over 30 N64 titles already available, the addition of these classics would undoubtedly enhance the nostalgia factor for gamers.

As Nintendo continues to expand its classic games library, the anticipation for these potential releases grows. Will we soon see Donkey Kong 64 and Super Smash Bros. join the ranks of other iconic titles on the Switch? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the excitement around Nintendo's retro offerings is far from over.
