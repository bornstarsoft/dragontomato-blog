Tango Gameworks is making waves in the gaming industry with a complete rebranding and a fresh hiring spree for an unannounced action game. Just six months after being acquired by Krafton, the studio is not only revamping its identity but also expanding its team to bring new creative visions to life. With a focus on console game development, this shift signals an exciting new chapter for the studio known for hits like Hi-Fi RUSH.

The company is actively seeking experienced developers who are passionate about crafting innovative gaming experiences. Interestingly, the job listings emphasize console experience over PC, which reflects the traditional focus of Japanese game development. This strategic move hints at Tango's commitment to delivering high-quality console titles, potentially setting the stage for a new franchise or a sequel to their previous successes.

As Tango Gameworks unveils its new logo and philosophy, the anticipation builds around what this unannounced project could entail. Will it be a continuation of the Hi-Fi RUSH universe, or something entirely new? With a talented team already in place, including key figures from their previous titles, the future looks promising. What are your thoughts on this rebranding and the potential directions Tango Gameworks might take?
