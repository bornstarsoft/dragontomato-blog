Rare has announced an exciting new feature for Sea of Thieves: paid custom servers will be introduced in early 2026. This announcement, made during the games first community direct, Custom Seas, promises to enhance the gameplay experience by allowing players to create private servers tailored to their preferences. While specific pricing details are yet to be revealed, Rare has indicated that supporting this feature will come with a monthly fee, reflecting the investment required to maintain such a service.

In addition to custom servers, Rare is also revamping the games seasonal model. Starting with Season 17, each season will be divided into three distinct phases, focusing on reinvigorating the sandbox experience, hosting live events, and fostering community engagement. This strategic overhaul aims to address the stagnation felt in recent seasons and bring fresh excitement to the game.

As Sea of Thieves continues to evolve, the introduction of paid custom servers and a new seasonal structure could significantly change the way players interact with the game. Will these updates breathe new life into the pirate adventure, or will they face challenges in execution? Only time will tell.
