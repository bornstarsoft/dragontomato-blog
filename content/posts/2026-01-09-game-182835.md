The highly anticipated action RPG, Avowed, is set to make its debut on PlayStation 5 next month, bringing with it a host of exciting new features. Scheduled for release on February 17, the PS5 version will coincide with an anniversary update that introduces a New Game Plus mode, new races, new weapon types, and a Photo Mode. This move reflects Microsofts strategy of expanding its gaming ecosystem across multiple platforms, ensuring that more players can experience the rich world of Eora.

Originally launched on Xbox consoles and PC, Avowed has garnered attention for its immersive gameplay and engaging narrative. Obsidian Entertainment has described the upcoming anniversary update as a "more rounded experience" compared to the original release. With a solid reputation for crafting entertaining RPGs, Obsidian aims to enhance player engagement and satisfaction with these new additions.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits the PS5 launch, the question remains: will Avoweds new features elevate it to a must-play title in 2026?
