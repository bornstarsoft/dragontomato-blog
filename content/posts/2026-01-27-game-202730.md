In an intriguing turn of events, Walmart may have inadvertently revealed two upcoming GameCube classics for the Nintendo Switch Online service: Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2. This leak, spotted by vigilant social media users, raises questions about the timing of Nintendo's announcements and the potential for these beloved titles to make a comeback on the platform.

Currently, Nintendo has only confirmed three GameCube games for future release: Super Mario Sunshine, Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokmon Colosseum, with no specific dates provided. The inclusion of Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2 in Walmart's listing could either be a simple error or a premature reveal of Nintendo's plans.

As fans eagerly await more details, the prospect of revisiting these classic titles on the Switch is exciting. With the recent remaster of Metroid Prime and the standalone HD releases of the first two Pikmin games, it seems like the perfect time for Nintendo to expand its GameCube offerings. What other classics do you hope to see added to the Nintendo Switch Online library?
