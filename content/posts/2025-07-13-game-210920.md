If youre a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to grab a copy of Haus Of Irndrous for free on Steam! Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric puzzle horror game is currently available at no cost until July 19, 2025. After this date, it will transition to a paid model, costing $1.99. This unique opportunity allows players to experience the first chapter of the game without any financial commitment.

Originally launched in early access in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous was designed to be an episodic experience, with the first chapter always intended to be free. However, the developers have decided to implement a price tag to help fund future chapters and support server costs. This shift in business model is not uncommon in the gaming industry, as seen with other titles making similar transitions on Steam.

As Yxtopia Studios continues to refine the game based on player feedback, the recent update 17.0 has introduced improvements in enemy AI and performance optimizations, setting the stage for future content expansions. Will you take advantage of this limited-time offer and dive into the eerie world of Haus Of Irndrous? Dont miss out on the chance to claim your free copy before its too late!
