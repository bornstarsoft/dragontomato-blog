In a bittersweet announcement, the beloved smartphone game "Gotōbun no Hanayome Itsutsugo-chan wa Puzzle o Gotōbun Dekinai" based on The Quintessential Quintuplets franchise will officially end its service on June 30, 2025. Launched in October 2020, this game captivated fans with its engaging puzzle mechanics and charming characters, but it seems that even the most popular titles must eventually say goodbye.

As of now, in-game currency sales have ceased, but players can still utilize their existing currency until the service concludes. The developers have promised refunds for any unused currency, ensuring that players are not left empty-handed. This closure marks a significant moment for fans who have enjoyed the game over the years, as it transitions into the annals of gaming history.

Interestingly, the franchise continues to thrive with new releases, including the recent console game "Gotōbun no Hanayome: Kanojo to Kawasu Itsutsu no Yakusoku" and the upcoming "Gotōbun no Princess: Gensō to Shinen to Mahō Gakuin." These developments suggest that while one chapter may be closing, the world of The Quintessential Quintuplets is far from over. How will fans adapt to this change, and what new adventures await them in the franchise?
