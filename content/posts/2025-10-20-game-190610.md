In a recent interview, renowned Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu expressed his firm stance against using generative AI in music creation. Uematsu believes that the true reward of composing music lies in the challenges and struggles that come with the creative process. He stated, "Ive never used it, and I probably never will," emphasizing that the satisfaction derived from personal effort is irreplaceable.

Uematsu also highlighted the importance of the human story behind music, suggesting that listeners often find enjoyment in understanding the background of the composer. While he sees potential for AI in other audio elements of gaming, such as track transitions, he remains skeptical about its role in the core creative process of music composition. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the balance between human creativity and AI assistance develops in the future.
