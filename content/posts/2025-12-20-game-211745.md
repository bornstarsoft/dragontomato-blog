On December 19, Wordle players around the globe faced an unexpected challenge when the five-letter word of the day was "myrrh"a word devoid of vowels. This choice sparked a wave of frustration and disbelief among players, many of whom took to social media to express their discontent. The New York Times even described the puzzle as moderately challenging, but for many, it felt like an insurmountable hurdle.

The incident highlights the diverse strategies players employ when tackling Wordle puzzles, often focusing on identifying vowels first. However, the absence of vowels in this particular word left many players scrambling.
