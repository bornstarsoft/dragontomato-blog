In a surprising revelation, a player has discovered that installing all downloadable content (DLC) for Monster Hunter Wilds can significantly enhance the game's performance on PC. According to Reddit user de_Tylmarande, the game experiences drastic frame rate improvements when all DLC is present, potentially due to an aggressive DLC ownership check function that hampers performance for players with only the base game.

After conducting tests on different accounts, de_Tylmarande noted that their performance issues vanished when logged into a friend's account that had all DLC installed. This led them to hypothesize that the game performs better with more DLC, as the frequent checks for DLC presence create unnecessary performance bottlenecks. To validate this theory, they even created a mod that bypasses these checks, resulting in a remarkable increase in frame rates.

This discovery raises questions about how developers manage DLC checks and their impact on gameplay. With Capcom now aware of the issue, it will be interesting to see if they implement changes to improve performance for players who may not want to invest in all available DLC. Could this lead to a more optimized gaming experience for everyone?
