Indie developer Pixel Maniacs is making waves with their upcoming title, ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard, boldly claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious statement highlights the ongoing demand for innovative puzzle games reminiscent of the beloved Portal series. While Valve has left fans yearning for a Portal 3, ChromaGun 2 aims to fill that void with its own unique twist on the genre.

Set in a vibrant world where players utilize a color-shifting gun to manipulate objects, ChromaGun 2 draws visual inspiration from Portal but leans more towards the puzzle mechanics found in games like Qube. The absence of portals in favor of colored blocks offers a fresh take on puzzle-solving, ensuring that players will engage with challenges in new and exciting ways. With a free demo available on Steam, gamers can get a taste of this promising sequel before its full release.

The original ChromaGun, released in 2016, received 'Mostly Positive' reviews, setting high expectations for its successor. As Pixel Maniacs continues to innovate, it will be interesting to see how ChromaGun 2 resonates with both fans of the original and newcomers to the genre. Will it successfully capture the spirit of Portal while carving out its own identity? Only time will tell.
