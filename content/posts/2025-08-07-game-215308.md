In a recent Q&A session, Sony's CFO Lin Tao revealed that the highly anticipated game Marathon is expected to launch by the end of March 2026. This announcement comes after the game's official delay, which was attributed to the need for further refinement and testing. Tao emphasized that while the company is optimistic about the release, it is not yet a formal commitment, highlighting the ongoing development adjustments being made.

Additionally, Tao discussed the evolving relationship between Sony and Bungie, indicating that Bungie's independence is gradually diminishing as it becomes more integrated into PlayStation Studios. This strategic shift aims to streamline operations and enhance collaboration between the two entities, ultimately benefiting the gaming community with more cohesive game development.

As we look forward to the potential launch of Marathon, it raises questions about the future of Bungie's creative direction under Sony's management. Will this integration lead to innovative gaming experiences, or could it stifle Bungie's unique creative voice? Only time will tell.
