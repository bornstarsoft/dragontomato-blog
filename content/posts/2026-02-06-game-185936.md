Namco's iconic arcade title, Rave Racer, is finally making its way to home consoles, marking a significant moment for retro gaming enthusiasts. Originally released in 1995, Rave Racer was the last major arcade installment in the Ridge Racer series, and its upcoming home version is a nostalgic nod to the golden age of arcade gaming. This release is particularly exciting as it follows the first home release of the original Ridge Racer last year, showcasing the growing trend of bringing classic arcade experiences to modern platforms.

The home version of Rave Racer will be available on multiple platforms, including Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, and PS4, through Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives series. This re-release will not only include the original gameplay but also introduce new features like Time Attack Mode and Network Mode for online play, enhancing the overall experience. As we look forward to this release on February 26, it raises the question: what other classic arcade titles could benefit from a modern home port?
