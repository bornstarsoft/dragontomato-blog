Capcom's upcoming title, Pragmata, is set to redefine the gaming landscape with its innovative puzzle-shooting gameplay. Revealed during a recent live stream, players will engage in a unique blend of hacking robots through a puzzle mini-game while simultaneously dodging and shooting them. This dual-layered gameplay mechanic promises to deliver an engaging experience that challenges both strategic thinking and reflexes.

Set in a near-future lunar research station in crisis, players will step into the shoes of Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, alongside his android companion, Diana. The game's narrative and aesthetic are as intriguing as its gameplay, offering a fresh perspective in a market often dominated by sequels and franchises. With its first gameplay reveal, Pragmata showcases Capcom's commitment to delivering a polished and unique experience, despite the delays since its initial announcement in June 2020.

As we look forward to its release in 2026, the anticipation builds around how Pragmata will evolve its core ideas into a full-fledged experience. Will it live up to the high expectations set by Capcom's impressive track record? Only time will tell, but the initial impressions certainly leave us eager for more.
