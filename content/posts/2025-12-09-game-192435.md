In a groundbreaking revelation, Jorg Neumann, the head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, has disclosed that the initiative to bring the beloved flight sim to the PlayStation 5 was his own idea. This decision, he believes, has set off an "avalanche" of Xbox titles making their way to Sonys console. Neumann's vision came after a significant reduction in the game's file size, allowing for cloud streaming and opening the door for cross-platform possibilities.

Initially met with resistance from Xbox, the idea gained traction when Sony expressed interest, leading to the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5. This pivotal moment not only expands the game's reach but also signifies a shift in the gaming landscape where exclusivity is becoming less rigid. As we look ahead, the question remains: will this trend continue to blur the lines between console exclusives, and what could that mean for gamers worldwide?
