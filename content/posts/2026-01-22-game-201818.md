In the upcoming release of Yakuza Kiwami 3, the newly expanded orphanage section, Life at Morning Glory, is being hailed as the most essential part of the game. Director Ryosuke Horii emphasizes that players should not rush through this segment, as it offers a deeper understanding of protagonist Kazuma Kiryu's role as a father figure. This life simulation aspect allows players to engage in daily activities with the children, fostering bonds that enrich the overall narrative.

Originally, the orphanage content in Yakuza 3 was somewhat fragmented, but the remake aims to provide a more immersive experience. By incorporating mini-games such as cooking, fishing, and helping with homework, players can truly experience the nuances of parenting. Horii's personal insights as a father add authenticity to this portrayal, making it a vital part of Kiryu's journey.

As Yakuza Kiwami 3 prepares for its release on February 12, gamers are left wondering how this new approach will redefine their connection to the characters. Will you take the time to explore the depths of Life at Morning Glory, or will you rush through to the action? The choice is yours, but it seems clear that this section is set to leave a lasting impact on the Yakuza series.
