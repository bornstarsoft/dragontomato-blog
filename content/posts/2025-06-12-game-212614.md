In an impressive feat for the gaming community, *Stellar Blade* has become the second PlayStation-published game to surpass 100,000 concurrent players on Steam. Released just recently for PC, the game has seen a steady increase in its player count, peaking at an impressive 100,904 concurrent players. This milestone not only highlights the game's popularity but also emphasizes the growing trend of PlayStation titles making a significant impact on the PC gaming landscape.

While *Stellar Blade* has made its mark, it still trails behind *Helldivers 2*, which achieved an astounding peak of 458,709 concurrent players last year. The competition among PlayStation titles on Steam is fierce, with other notable mentions like *Ghost of Tsushima: Directorâ€™s Cut* and *God of War* also making the top ten list. This trend indicates a promising future for PlayStation games on PC, as more players embrace these titles beyond console gaming.

As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see how *Stellar Blade* continues to evolve in the gaming community and whether it can sustain its momentum. Will it challenge the record set by *Helldivers 2*, or will new releases take the spotlight? Only time will tell.
