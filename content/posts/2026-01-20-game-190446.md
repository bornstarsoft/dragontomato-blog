As we approach the 35th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog, it's essential to remember that Sega has more than one beloved franchise celebrating this milestone. Puyo Puyo, a puzzle game that has captivated audiences since its debut in 1991, is also marking its 35th anniversary. This reminder from Sega highlights the diverse legacy of their gaming catalog, showcasing how franchises evolve and maintain relevance over decades.

Originally released on the Famicon Disk System, Puyo Puyo took inspiration from classic titles like Tetris and infused it with a whimsical charm that appealed to a younger audience. Sega's acquisition of the franchise in 1998 allowed it to flourish under the guidance of Sonic Team, leading to modern successes like Puyo Puyo Tetris. As fans eagerly anticipate celebrations for Sonic, it's worth considering how Sega can also honor Puyo Puyo's unique contributions to gaming.

With both franchises reaching significant anniversaries, the gaming community is left wondering what surprises Sega has in store. Will we see new game releases, remasters, or even crossovers? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: Sega's legacy is richer than many realize, and both Sonic and Puyo Puyo deserve their moment in the spotlight.
